to add framework to existing project

struts-->action class-> servlet-->controller

URL provided in the configuration file unlike the response.send redirect or dispatcher ==>stutsconfig.xml
(url need not be changed in the java cod and chnges are made in the config file, here, independent modules are made which are decoupled with each other)

action is a predefined servlet action servlet

now in struts we will make action servlet instead of http servlet

it has a execute method by default(which is similar to doFilter of the filter)
attributes are passed here==> (ActionMapping mappinf,ActionForm form,Request,Response)
i.e. objects of actions maping,action form, request and response are passed

execute method is of the type Actionform


till now we had
view==>>http servlet==>>which is redirected to success or error page


now we will have in struts
view==>action servlet==>>stustconfig.xml(for success or error url) and from there it will be forwarded to ==>>success page or error page

normally bean class is used for storing data
here there is a form bean which is used to validate
and it has getter setter methods which extracts the parameters

(for a flow diagram look in notes)
